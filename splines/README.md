# Task on yield curve smoothing using splines

Below are the yields (in percentage points) on Swiss government bonds as of July 2015:

| T | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 7 | 10 | 20 | 30 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| y(0,T)  | -0.79 |-0.73| -0.65| -0.55| -0.33| -0.04 | 0.54|0.73|

Construct the forward curve using Lorimier's method for Î±=0.1. Report the yield on a zero-coupon bond with 6 years to maturity. 
Express your answer in percentage points and round to 2 decimal places.
